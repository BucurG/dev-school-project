# Deployment

We already covered the local deployment using Docker and Docker Compose. We're leaving the deployment to Cloud to you!
Since you have your application image in the ACR, you can make use of it in the pipeline and run the application in another environment.

Some suggestions:
- on a VM in the Azure;
- on a Container in Azure;
- using an Azure App service for deploying it;
**Sky is the limit!**
