# This will be the skeleton for your final project

You have full liberty in how you want to design you application, here are the basic requirements:
- you have to use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- you need to have a [RESTful api](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/RESTful-API) 
- you have to create multiple routes (endpoints) for your aplication 
- you need to use all HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
- you need to query an [external API](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)

File structure example:

```
final-project
|   app.py
|   requirements.txt
----tmp
    |   data.json

```
> **_NOTE:_** We recommend using a different file for each class you create. <br />
> **_NOTE:_** The data.json file is file that needs to be populated with data you will use in your GET, PUT, POST, DELETE methods.
